# Tensorflow.js Regression


## What it does:
This is an interactive visualization for finding the 'line of best fit' for different types of Regression. Built by Chandra Kanth, it includes options where the user can specify the type of regression - Linear, Binomial or Trinomial. You can also can select the type of optimizer - stochastic gradient descent or Adam.

An online canvas where we can interactively work with different types of Regression and two different types of Optimizer is along with it. <br>
